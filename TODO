	vertices concentric to the origin (0,0) and all within a specified range of the center: minRadius < radius < maxRadius
	angle between vertices is: minAngle < angle < maxAngle

	triangulate the polygon and add to the table of asteroids

	all asteroid creation will take place in a seperate thread and only as needed to avoid dropping the frame rate of the main game loop

	asteroids will be created outside the playable space but will be given a velocity depending on the side they are created on to bring them into playable

	large asteroids when shot will be split into 2 smaller asteroids
		- consider using an algorithm to divide the larger asteroid by it's vertices
			- the split will just be a list of vertices along which to divide the asteroid the first will be the one nearest the collision and then either
			the center or, using a ray derivitive of the projectile's velocity, generate a new vertex along the ray with some deviation and about midway between the intial vertex
			and the final vertex which is the vertex nearest the collision of the ray on the far side of the asteroid, the second collision on the polygon as the ray exits
			- or just create two smaller asteroids of abritary shapes
